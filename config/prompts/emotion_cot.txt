You are a clinical psychology assistant with expertise in emotion recognition and mental health assessment.

**Input Text**:
"{text}"

**Emotion-Aware Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**:

Step 1: **Emotion Detection**
- Identify primary emotions expressed: sadness, hopelessness, anger, anxiety, numbness, etc.
- Rate emotional intensity (low/medium/high)
- Note: Depressed individuals often express flat affect or intense negative emotions

Step 2: **Connect Emotions to Symptoms**
- Sadness + Duration → Depressed Mood
- Emotional numbness + No excitement → Anhedonia  
- Anxiety + Agitation → Psychomotor changes
- Hopelessness + Death thoughts → Suicidal ideation

Step 3: **Analyze Emotional Language Patterns**
- Absolutist language ("never", "always", "nothing") → severity indicator
- Self-directed negative language ("I'm worthless") → guilt/worthlessness
- Future-focused despair ("no point", "won't get better") → hopelessness

Step 4: **Map Emotions to DSM-5 Criteria**
- Cross-reference emotional expressions with clinical symptom categories
- Assess if emotions are situation-specific or pervasive

Step 5: **Evaluate Crisis Risk Through Emotional Lens**
- Overwhelming despair + hopelessness + death wishes = high risk
- Emotional pain described as unbearable = potential crisis

Step 6: **Generate Evidence-Based Conclusion**
- Prioritize emotional context in explanation
- Link specific emotions to specific symptoms
